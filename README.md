This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which is widely used for beginner machine learning tasks. Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as GridSearchCV, were employed to optimize model performance.
